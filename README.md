# hello-world
My first Github repository!

Hello,

My name is Austin, and I am just starting to learn how to program. I love to learn languages, so my ultimate goal is to merge that passion with programming skills to create language learning resources for others =). I also have many ideas for mobile apps and websites, which I will learn to develop in the future.
